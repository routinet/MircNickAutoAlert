MircNickAutoAlert
=================

Save script.ini into your mirc scripts directory (usually \users\<username>\appdata\roaming\mirc\scripts).  Load through mirc (alt-r).

There is a reference to beep-beep-beep.wav.  Change that reference to any wav file of your choice.  It will be played any time your nick appears in an unfocused window.
